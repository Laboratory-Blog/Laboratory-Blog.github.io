Microsoft officially announced the Visual Studio Code project at the Build Developers Conference on April 30, 2015: A cross-platform source code editor for modern web and cloud applications running on Mac OS X, Windows and Linux .Somasegar, president of Microsoft's Developer Division, told the author earlier this week. "We want them to be able to use our company's products on the platforms they are used to, rather than having to migrate to Windows." Many developers on these platforms are also more willing to use a lightweight code editor like Sublime Text instead of a full-featured IDE like Visual Studio.The editor also integrates all the features that a modern editor should have, including syntax high lighting, customizable key bindings, bracket matching, and code snippets. Collect (snippets). Somasegar also told the author that this editor also has out-of-the-box support for Git.

it's from intelliJ IDEA,is a profession for Python.PyCharm is a Python IDE with a set of tools that help users improve their productivity when developing in the Python language, such as debugging, syntax highlighting, Project management, code jumping, smart prompting, auto-completion, unit testing, version control. . In addition, the IDE provides advanced features to support professional web development under the Django framework.It can be bound to Textmate, NetBeans, Eclipse & Emacs keyboard master, and Vi/Vim emulation plugin.
## Java
I recommend Eclipse

prominent example of an Eclipse-based application is IBM Rational Software Architect, which forms the basis of the IBM Java development tools family.This equality and consistency is not limited to Java development tools. Although Eclipse was developed using the Java language, its use is not limited to the Java language; for example, plugins that support programming languages ​​such as C/C++, COBOL, PHP, Android, etc. are already available, or are expected to be available. The Eclipse framework can also be used as a basis for other types of applications that are not related to software development, such as content management systems.
