## VI & VIM
The difference between vi and vim
They are all multi-mode editors, the difference is that vim is an upgraded version of vi, it is not only compatible with all the instructions of vi, but also some new features.

These advantages of vim are mainly reflected in the following aspects:
1, multi-level undo
We know that in vi, pressing u can only undo the last command, and in vim you can undo it without restriction.

2, ease of use

Vi can only run in Unix, and vim can not only run on Unix, windows, mac and other multi-operation platforms.

3, the syntax highlights
Vim can brighten your code with different colors.

4, visual operation
That is to say, vim can run not only in the terminal, but also in x window, mac os, windows.

5, fully compatible with vi
In some cases, you can use vim as vi.

Both vi and vim are editors in Linux. The difference is that vim is more advanced and can be considered an upgraded version of vi. Vi is used for text editing, but vim is more suitable for coding.

Vi has 3 modes: insert mode, command mode, low line mode.

Insert mode: In this mode, you can enter characters and press ESC to return to command mode.
Command mode: You can move the cursor, delete characters, and so on.
Low line mode: can save files, exit vi, set vi, find and other functions (low line mode can also be regarded as in command mode).
